        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>Born and raised in Suffolk, Virginia (the peanut capital of the world), I began my journey as a pianist and a mathematician. Upon completing high school, I studied at Longwood College in Farmville, Virginia and obtained a Bachelor of Music in Piano Performance. After graduation, I moved to Richmond, Virginia and began working toward a career in software development. I completed a post-baccaulerate program at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in computer science. I worked at Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) on a contract for the United States Navy maintaining code for the Aegis Weapon System. I later transitioned into a position as a consultant for a Microsoft Gold Partner where I did SharePoint development for compainies located in the Richmond area. While I enjoyed working as a developer, I also wanted to explore opportunities in education. I spent some time as a piano teacher, which also allowed me to spend time practicing classical music at the piano. After some time, I decided to pursue a degree in teaching mathematics at the University of Richmond. Since January 2015, I have been teaching high school mathematics.</p>
        <p>After establishing myself as a high school math teacher, I decided that it was finally time to fulfill another life-long dream of moving to Colorado where I could be closer to the Rocky Mountains. Already Colorado feels like my home. I enjoy spending time cycling, hiking, snowboarding, and just enjoying the beautiful Colorado views.</p>
